      <h2>About the Book</h2>
      <p><strong><em>The Mirage and the Tide</em></strong> is a story built on contrasts — light and shadow, truth and illusion, the known and the unknowable. Its heart beats in the ancient city of Jodhpur, among blue-washed walls and an ancestral haveli whose stones remember more than they reveal. The world it paints is both tactile and dreamlike: the sting of desert dust on the skin, the deep hush before a summer storm, the strange clarity of a mirage shimmering in the heat. </p>
      <p>This is not a tale of grand armies or sweeping politics; it is a deeply personal exploration of how a single life can fracture and transform. It is a meditation on identity, belonging, and the invisible forces that shape our fate. The desert becomes the landscape of longing — a place where hope and deception blur together. The tide becomes the embodiment of life’s relentless trials — each wave pulling the soul toward surrender or survival.</p>
      <p>The narrative moves like water, at times still enough to reflect every detail of a moment, and at times crashing forward in sudden, unstoppable surges. Myth lingers at its edges, but the core remains human: grief that echoes, love that evades, and truth that hides in plain sight. It asks the reader not only to follow Pratap’s journey, but to stand at the same threshold — between the mirage and the tide — and decide what they believe is real.</p>

      <h2>Basic Outline</h2>
      <ul class="outline-list">
        <p><strong>Pratap Singh’s</strong> life begins with promise. His parents name him <strong>“Goodluck”</strong>, believing he will be a blessing to the family. For years, his childhood feels ordinary, even secure, until tragedy strikes — his parents are killed in an accident. Or so the world believes. Within the family, whispers grow: it was no accident, but a calculated act by relatives seeking to secure their claim to the royal lineage.</p>
        <p>Those relatives declare that Pratap, his parents, and his grandparents are not truly of royal blood. This belief becomes the weapon with which they strip him of dignity, inheritance, and respect. Bullied by his cousins, treated as a servant within his own ancestral home, Pratap’s world narrows to just two sources of comfort: the haveli itself, and the love of his grandparents.</p>
        <p>The truth is far different — Pratap’s claim is legitimate, and the cruelty he endures is rooted not in truth, but in greed and pride. Most of the family’s wealth is taken from him, leaving only the haveli as his anchor. Financial hardship, social humiliation, and emotional isolation erode his spirit.</p>
        <p>One stormy night, sitting on the roof, lightning strikes him. Darkness swallows him whole. When he wakes, he stands between two endless landscapes — a furious ocean and a barren desert — each reflecting the forces that have shaped his life.</p>

        <h2>Meet the Protagonist</h2>
        <p><strong>Name:</strong> <span class="regal">Pratap Singh</span> <em class="aka"> <strong>aka “Goodluck”</strong></em></p>
        <p>Born into a royal lineage of <strong>Jodhpur, Rajasthan</strong>, Pratap’s world now holds only a fading ancestral haveli and the ghosts of a grand past. He lives with his grandparents—the last fortress of warmth in a world that seems intent on erasing him. Pratap is a very young man (merely 20) caught in the crosswinds of identity and rejection. Known by everyone as “Goodluck” — a name given by his parents in hope and love — he grows up believing he belongs. That belief begins to crumble the day his parents die.</p>
        <p>Pratap does not fight his circumstances with aggression; instead, he endures them quietly, carrying the weight of insult and loss like an anchor. He works within the haveli, not because he chooses to, but because his cousins force him into servitude. Outwardly, he bends to survive. Inwardly, he questions why his own blood rejects him.</p>
        <p>He clings to his grandparents, who remain his only defenders. The haveli becomes his sanctuary, a place where he can breathe without judgment. Still, he cannot escape the gnawing feeling of being out of place — a black mark on a family obsessed with its own purity.</p>
        <p>Pratap fantasizes about escape: sometimes in the form of a life far away from Jodhpur, sometimes in dreams where he is recognized for who he truly is. In love, he feels cursed, as if affection itself retreats from him.</p>
        <p>On the night of the lightning strike, Pratap’s inner and outer worlds collide. He falls into darkness, awakens between the roaring ocean and the endless desert, and stands in a place that feels like both a judgment and a promise. It is here, on this strange shore, that his journey truly begins.</p>

      <h2>A Story Still in the Making</h2>
      <p><strong><em>The Mirage and the Tide</em></strong> is a journey still in its infancy. At present, the author has traced only the opening steps — the life Pratap knew before the lightning, and the moment he awakens between the raging ocean and the endless desert. Beyond that shore, the path remains unwritten.</p>
      <p>The world of the novel is still taking shape. Each grain of desert sand, each swell of the ocean’s tide, is part of an intricate world-building process that continues to unfold. What happens next could take many forms. Perhaps the afterlife scene is nothing more than Pratap’s mind inventing an escape from the cruelty of his reality. Or perhaps it is exactly what it seems — Pratap has died, and now stands in the afterlife, his soul weighing its own existence.</p>
      <p>If that is true, other questions ripple outward. What happens in the living world when Pratap dies? How do his grandparents react? Do his spiteful relatives grieve, or do they see opportunity?</p>
      <p>The truth is, only time will decide. The answers — and Pratap’s fate — will be revealed when the novel reaches its conclusion. That day is expected to come sometime in <strong>2027</strong>. Until then, the tide waits.</p>
